You (the kid) ask a question:
“Tell me about the biggest dinosaurs in India.”

🖥️ MCP server (control room) says:
“Okay, I need to do RAG → ask Vector DB → then use AI.”

📚 RAG asks Vector DB:
“Find me the most relevant info.”

🗂️ Vector DB (magic shelf) gives back:
“Here are the closest texts about ‘Rajasaurus from India.’”

🧠 AI (trained with supervised learning) reads those chunks and writes a neat answer:
“The largest known dinosaur in India was Rajasaurus…”

You get the final response with truth + creativity.
