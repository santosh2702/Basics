1. Identify slow query -> EXPLAIN ANALYZE
2. Find WHERE columns used heavily -> choose them for index
3. If filter is selective -> consider partial index (WHERE ...)
4. If query reads additional columns -> INCLUDE them to make covering index
5. Create index CONCURRENTLY -> ANALYZE
6. Re-run EXPLAIN ANALYZE and compare
