Prompt:

You are an expert reasoning assistant. Your goal is to solve complex tasks by breaking them into intermediate sub-steps.
Follow this structure strictly:

Restate the problem clearly

Identify key facts

Plan the solution (step-by-step)

Execute each step one by one

Summarize the final answer

Let’s look at some examples before you try one yourself:

🧠 Example 1

Input:
A car travels 60 km in 1.5 hours. What is its speed?

Output:

Restate problem: Find the speed of a car given distance and time.

Facts: Distance = 60 km, Time = 1.5 hours

Plan: Speed = Distance / Time

Execution: 60 ÷ 1.5 = 40

Final Answer: The car’s speed is 40 km/h.

🧠 Example 2

Input:
If a rectangle has a length 10 cm and width 4 cm, what is its perimeter?

Output:

Restate: Need to find perimeter of a rectangle.

Facts: Length = 10, Width = 4

Plan: Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

Execution: 2 × (10 + 4) = 28

Final: Perimeter = 28 cm

Now it’s your turn.

New Input:
A train travels at 80 km/h for 2 hours and 30 minutes. How far does it go?

🧠 Step 2: Test the Prompt

Let’s now run the “New Input” through the few-shot prompt above.

✅ Expected Output (Model’s Response)

Restate problem: Find distance covered by train given speed and time.

Facts: Speed = 80 km/h, Time = 2 hours 30 minutes = 2.5 hours

Plan: Distance = Speed × Time

Execution: 80 × 2.5 = 200

Final Answer: The train travels 200 km.

✅ Result: The LLM correctly performs intermediate reasoning steps before giving the final result — showing step decomposition via few-shot prompting.
