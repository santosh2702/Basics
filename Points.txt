 - What are the potential issues with using consistent hashing for music streaming servers?
 - What are the pros and cons of using pre-loaded hints versus server-loaded hints in an application?
 - How would you process a file that is larger than the available RAM on a single system?
 - You are tasked with building a sports news classification service that downloads articles and applies machine learning to detect bias. What information would you require to estimate the resources needed for this system?
 - When expanding a production-ready application to multiple countries, what backend changes and considerations must be taken into account?

𝗕. 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗥𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱:
 - Given a list of words Words = ["baby", "cat", "dada", "dog"] and a random jumbled string like ctay, write a function find(words, word1) that returns the word if it can be formed from the characters of the given string.
 - Example: 
 - find(words, "ctay") → returns "cat"
 - find(words, "dad") → returns "-" (not found)

 - Given a 2D matrix of characters, determine if a given word exists in the matrix by moving only right or down.

 - How would you implement and manage this system in a multithreaded environment?

𝗥𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝟰: 𝗦𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝗥𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱
 - Design a Web Scraper system that:
 - Starts with an initial set of URLs.
 - Scrapes all nested URLs recursively.
 - Extracts and returns all image links, mapped against their respective parent URLs. 
 - Follow-up questions: 
 - Handling depth limits.
 - Optimizing scraping for speed and server load.
