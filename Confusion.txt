Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
→ Overall correctness.

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
→ Out of predicted positives, how many were actually positive?

Recall (Sensitivity, TPR) = TP / (TP + FN)
→ Out of actual positives, how many were correctly identified?

F1 Score = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
→ Balance between Precision & Recall.

Specificity (TNR) = TN / (TN + FP)
→ Out of actual negatives, how many were correctly identified?
